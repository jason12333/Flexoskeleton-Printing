# Flexoskeleton-Printing
## Project Overview

This project focuses on modifying traditional FDM 3D printing techonology to create 3D prints with improved material properties and functionalities based on low-cost and easily accessible fabrication tools. The key of this method relies on the direct deposition of normal FDM filaments (e.g. ABS/PLA) onto a flexible yet inextensible backing film (e.g. PC, Polycarbonate) creating stuctures with improved flexibilities and functional features (e.g. jamming and interlocking) that stand out from traditional 3D printed components.
