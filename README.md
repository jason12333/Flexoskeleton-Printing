# Flexoskeleton-Printing
## Overview of flexoskeleton printing

Hybrid robots composed of rigid and soft elements have previously required access to expensive multi-material 3D printers, multi-step casting and machining processes, or limited material choice when using consumer grade fabrication methods. Here we introduce a new design and fabrication process to rapidly construct flexible exoskeleton-inspired robots called **‘flexoskeleton printing’**. We modify a consumer grade fused deposition material (FDM) 3D printer to deposit filament directly onto a heated thermoplastic base layer which provides extremely strong bond strength between deposited material and the inextensible, flexible base layer. This process significantly improves the fatigue resistance of printed components and enables a new class of insect-inspired robot morphologies.

## Instructions on flexoskeleton printing

Flexoskeleton printing is based on direct deposition of traditional FDM filaments (e.g. ABS/PLA) onto a flexible yet inextensible backing film (e.g. PC, Polycarbonate),
