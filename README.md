# Flexoskeleton-Printing
## Overview of flexoskeleton printing

Hybrid robots composed of rigid and soft elements have previously required access to expensive multi-material 3D printers, multi-step casting and machining processes, or limited material choice when using consumer grade fabrication methods. Here we introduce a new design and fabrication process to rapidly construct flexible exoskeleton-inspired robots called **"flexoskeleton printing"**. 

This process is based on the modification of consumer grade [fused deposition material (FDM) 3D printers](cite) to extrude rigid FDM filaments (e.g. ABS/PLA) directly onto a flexible yet inextensible thermoplastic backing layer (PC, Polycarbonate). Upon deposition, the two materials form strong and instant bonding based on properly tuned heatbed temperature and initial Z-level of the nozzle. This method significantly improves the fatigue resistance and large-angle bendability of printed components and enables a class of insect-inspired robot morphologies, such as joint limits based on jamming and interlocking of rigid [mushrooms](https:cite). 

## Instructions on flexoskeleton printing

Flexoskeleton printing is based on direct deposition of traditional FDM filaments (e.g. ABS/PLA) onto a flexible yet inextensible backing film (e.g. PC, Polycarbonate). It combines the design concepts from lamination with 


### Fabrication steps



Basic fabrication tools needed: 

a. [A commercial FDM 3D printer with heatedbed.](https://www.prusa3d.com/original-prusa-i3-mk3/)

b. [Thermoplastic backing layer (Polycarbonate, PC)](https://www.mcmaster.com/polycarbonate)


### Thermal bonding 

Bonding between the rigid filament (PLA/ABS) and the backing layer (PC) is achieved based on the [thermal bonding effect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0257897216312786) between different thermoplastic materials. High bonding strength is a product of high pressure and temperature between the thermoplastic interface. To do so, we adjust the nozzle to start at within 0.1mm above the backing layer. The heatbed is heated up to 80°C—100°C, with the nozzle around 200°C—220°C (depending on the materials you are printing). 

### "Mushroom" designs

The mushroom designs are printed jammable structures that can stiffen the flexoskeleton printed flexure upon reaching the joint limit. 

There are two main types of "mushroom" designs:

A. Straight mushrooms as flexion joint limits. 


B. Reverse mushrooms that locks up when the joints are flexed.
