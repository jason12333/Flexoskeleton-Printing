## Overview of flexoskeleton printing

Flexoskeleton printing is a rapid prototyping method based on the modification of traditional FDM 3D printing techonology to create 3D prints with improved material properties and functionalities. Tradtional FDM printing method includes the formation of both rigid and soft (semi-soft) structures based on The key of this method relies on the direct deposition of normal FDM filaments (e.g. ABS/PLA) onto a flexible yet inextensible backing film (e.g. PC, Polycarbonate) creating 3D printed parts with improved flexibilities and functional features (e.g. jamming and interlocking). Thus it does not require either fancy pritners nor contricated post-processing but rather an automatic formation of hy
