# Flexoskeleton-Printing
## Project Overview

This project focuses on modifying traditional FDM 3D printing techonology to create 3D prints with improved material properties and functionalities based on low-cost and easily accessible fabrication tools. The key of this method relies on the direct deposition of normal FDM filaments (e.g. ABS/PLA) onto a flexible yet inextensible backing film (e.g. PC. Polycarbonate) creating stuctures with improved flexibilities and functional morphologies that stand out from traditional 3D printed components. Bonding between the two constituent materials is done by properly tuned starting Z-level of the printhead nozzle with a high heatbed temperature (80°C-100°C). he whole process automatically grants improved flexibility and bendability to rigid components, while providing
