# Flexoskeleton-Printing
## Overview of flexoskeleton printing

Hybrid robots composed of rigid and soft elements have previously required access to expensive multi-material 3D printers, multi-step casting and machining processes, or limited material choice when using consumer grade fabrication methods. Here we introduce a new design and fabrication process to rapidly construct flexible exoskeleton-inspired robots called **"flexoskeleton printing"**. 

This method is based on the modification of consumer grade [fused deposition material (FDM) 3D printers](cite) to extrude rigid FDM filaments (e.g. ABS/PLA) directly onto a flexible yet inextensible thermoplastic backing layer (PC, Polycarbonate). Upon deposition, the two materials instantly form strong bonding based on properly tuned heatbed temperature and starting Z-level of the nozzle. This method significantly improves the fatigue resistance of printed components and enables a new class of insect-inspired robot morphologies, such as joint limits based on jamming or interlocking of rigid [mushrooms](https:cite)

Flexoskeleton printing is based on direct deposition of traditional FDM filaments (e.g. ABS/PLA) onto a flexible yet inextensible backing film (e.g. PC, Polycarbonate),
